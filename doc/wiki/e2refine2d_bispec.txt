|| ||path||string||Path for the refinement, default=auto||
|| ||input||string||The name of the file containing the particle data||
|| ||ncls||int||Number of classes to generate||
|| ||normproj||bool||Normalizes each projected vector into the MSA subspace. Note that this is different from normalizing the input images since the subspace is not expected to fully span the image||
|| ||fastseed||bool||Will seed the k-means loop quickly, but may produce less consistent results. Always use this when generating >~100 classes.||
|| ||iter||int||The total number of refinement iterations to perform||
|| ||nbasisfp||int||Number of MSA basis vectors to use when classifying particles||
|| ||automask||bool||Automasking during class-averaging to help with centering when particle density is high||
|| ||naliref||int||Number of alignment references to when determining particle orientations||
||-P||parallel||string||Run in parallel, specify type:<option>=<value>:<option>:<value>||
|| ||threads||int||Number of threads to run in parallel on a single computer when multi-computer parallelism isn't useful||
|| ||centeracf||bool||This option has been removed in favor of a new centering algorithm||
|| ||center||string||If the default centering algorithm (xform.center) doesn't work well, you can specify one of the others here (e2help.py processor center)||
||-c||check||bool||Checks the contents of the current directory to verify that e2refine2d.py command will work - checks for the existence of the necessary starting files and checks their dimensions. Performs no work ||
||-v||verbose||int||verbose level [0-9], higner number means higher level of verboseness||
|| ||maxshift||int||Maximum particle translation in x and y||
|| ||exclude||string||The named file should contain a set of integers, each representing an image from the input file to exclude.||
|| ||resume||bool||This will cause a check of the files in the current directory, and the refinement will resume after the last completed iteration. It's ok to alter other parameters.||
|| ||initial||string||File containing starting class-averages. If not specified, will generate starting averages automatically||
|| ||minchange||int||Minimum number of particles that change group before deicding to terminate. Default = -1 (auto)||
|| ||simalign||string||The name of an 'aligner' to use prior to comparing the images (default=rotate_translate_tree)||
|| ||simaligncmp||string||Name of the aligner along with its construction arguments (default=ccc)||
|| ||simralign||string||The name and parameters of the second stage aligner which refines the results of the first alignment||
|| ||simraligncmp||string||The name and parameters of the comparitor used by the second stage aligner. (default=dot).||
|| ||simcmp||string||The name of a 'cmp' to be used in comparing the aligned images (default=ccc)||
|| ||shrink||int||Optionally shrink the input particles by an integer amount prior to computing similarity scores. For speed purposes. default=0, no shrinking||
|| ||classkeep||float||The fraction of particles to keep in each class, based on the similarity score generated by the --cmp argument (default=0.8).||
|| ||classkeepsig||bool||Change the keep ('--keep') criterion from fraction-based to sigma-based.||
|| ||classiter||int||Number of iterations to use when making class-averages (default=4)||
|| ||classalign||string||If doing more than one iteration, this is the name and parameters of the 'aligner' used to align particles to the previous class average.||
|| ||classaligncmp||string||This is the name and parameters of the comparitor used by the fist stage aligner  Default is dot.||
|| ||classralign||string||The second stage aligner which refines the results of the first alignment in class averaging. Default is None.||
|| ||classraligncmp||string||The comparitor used by the second stage aligner in class averageing. Default is dot:normalize=1.||
|| ||classaverager||string||The averager used to generate the class averages. Default is 'mean'.||
|| ||classcmp||string||The name and parameters of the comparitor used to generate similarity scores, when class averaging. Default is ccc'||
|| ||classnormproc||string||Normalization applied during class averaging||
|| ||ppid||int||Set the PID of the parent process, used for cross platform PPID||
