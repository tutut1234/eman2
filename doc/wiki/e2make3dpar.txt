|| ||output||bool||Output reconstructed volume file name.||
|| ||input||bool||The input projections. Project should usually have the xform.projection header attribute, which is used for slice insertion||
|| ||input_model||bool||If the class-averages have the model_id parameter (produced by e2refinemulti.py), this will use only class-averages with the specified model_id for the reconstruction.||
|| ||tlt||string||An imod tlt file containing alignment angles. If specified slices will be inserted using these angles in the IMOD convention||
|| ||sym||bool||Set the symmetry; if no value is given then the model is assumed to have no symmetry.
Choices are: i, c, d, tet, icos, or oct.||
|| ||fillangle||float||An angular range used for both alt & az over which the projection should be averaged. Generally the angular step used when making projections.||
|| ||pad||string||Will zero-pad images to the specifed size (x,y) or (x,x) prior to reconstruction. If not specified or 0 no padding occurs. If a negative value is specified automatic padding is performed. ||
|| ||padvol||string||Defines the dimensions (x,y,z) or (x,x,x) of the reconstructed volume. If ommitted, implied value based on padded 2D images is used.||
|| ||outsize||string||Defines the dimensions (x,y,z) or (x,x,x) of the final volume written to disk, if ommitted, size will be based on unpadded input size||
|| ||savenorm||string||If set, will save the normalization volume showing Fourier space filling to the specified file||
|| ||keep||float||The fraction of slices to keep, based on quality scores (1.0 = use all slices). See keepsig.||
|| ||keepsig||bool||If set, keep will be interpreted as a standard deviation coefficient instead of as a percentage.||
|| ||keepabs||bool||If set, keep will refer to the absolute quality of the class-average, not a local quality relative to other similar sized classes.||
|| ||no_wt||bool||This argument turns automatic weighting off causing all images to be weighted by 1. If this argument is not specified images inserted into the reconstructed volume are weighted by the number of particles that contributed to them (i.e. as in class averages), which is extracted from the image header (as the ptcl_repr attribute).||
|| ||sqrt_wt||bool||Normally class-averages are weighted into the reconstruction based on the number of particles in the average. This option causes the sqrt of the number of particles to be used instead.||
|| ||iterative||bool||Uses iterative interpolation in Fourier space instead of single step gridding or interpolation. --mode and --usessnr are ignored with this option.||
|| ||itermask||string||Used in iterative mode to define a mask to apply between iterations. The resulting reconstruction won't be masked per-se, but will be biased towards lower densities outside the mask.||
|| ||usessnr||bool||Makes use of the class_ssnr header data to weight each slice during insertion, instead of the default behavior of just using the number of particles in the average as a global weight.||
|| ||mode||string||Fourier reconstruction 'mode' to use. The default should not normally be changed. default='gauss_var'||
|| ||noradcor||bool||Normally a radial correction will be applied based on the --mode used. This option disables that correction.||
|| ||seedmap||string||If specified this volume will be used as a starting point for the reconstruction, filling any missing values in Fourier space. experimental.||
|| ||seedweight||float||If seedmap specified, this is how strongly the seedmap will bias existing values. 1 is default, and is equivalent to a one particle weight.||
|| ||seedweightmap||string||Specify a full map of weights for the seed. This must be in the same format as the --savenorm output map.||
||-v||verbose||int||verbose level [0-9], higner number means higher level of verboseness||
|| ||threads||int||Number of threads to run in parallel on a single computer. This is the only parallelism supported by e2make3dpar||
|| ||preprocess||string||preprocessor to be applied to the projections prior to 3D insertion. There can be more than one preprocessor and they are applied in the order in which they are specifed. Applied before padding occurs. See e2help.py processors for a complete list of available processors.||
|| ||setsf||string||Force the structure factor to match a 'known' curve prior to postprocessing (<filename>, auto or none). default=none||
|| ||postprocess||string||postprocessor to be applied to the 3D volume once the reconstruction is completed. There can be more than one postprocessor, and they are applied in the order in which they are specified. See e2help.py processors for a complete list of available processors.||
|| ||apix||float||A/pix value for output, overrides automatic values||
|| ||ppid||int||Set the PID of the parent process, used for cross platform PPID||
