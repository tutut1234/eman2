|| ||path||string||Path to a folder containing current results (default = highest spt_XX)||
|| ||iter||int||Iteration number within path. Default = auto||
|| ||bins||int||Number of bins to use in the histogram||
|| ||gui||bool||If set will open an interactive plot with the results||
|| ||mode||string||Which variable to histogram, score, coverage, alpha, tx, ty. default=score||
|| ||cmp||string||A comparitor used to generate new quality scores. Will add an additional column with --extract, otherwise replaces score for this run.||
|| ||multicmp||bool||If set will apply a range of different comparators to the aligned particle data and generate a multicolumn text file||
|| ||ref||string||A reference image to be used in conjunction with --cmp and --multicmp||
|| ||extract||bool||If set, will convert the .json file to a .txt file suitable for plotting. No histogramming is involved, this is a per-particle conversion||
