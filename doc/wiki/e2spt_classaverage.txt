|| ||input||string||Default=None. The name of the input volume stack. MUST be HDF since volume stack support is required.||
|| ||ref||string||Default=None. Reference image. Used as an initial alignment reference. The refinements are 'gold standard' by default, and therefore two independent copies of the reference will be generated and randomphase-lowpass filtered to the resolution specified through --refrandphase. To turn dataset splitting and gold standard refinement off, supply --goldstandardoff.||
|| ||apix||float||Default=0.0 (not used). Use this apix value where relevant instead of whatever is in the header of the reference and the particles.||
|| ||align||string||Default is rotate_translate_3d_tree. See e2help.py aligners to see the list of parameters the aligner takes (for example, if there's symmetry, supply --align rotate_translate_3d_tree:sym=icos). This is the aligner used to align particles to the previous class average. Specify 'None' (with capital N) to disable.||
|| ||aligncmp||string||Default=ccc.tomo.thresh. The comparator used for the --align aligner. Do not specify unless you need to use another specific aligner.||
|| ||clip||int||Default=0 (which means it's not used). Boxsize to clip particles as part of preprocessing to speed up alignment. For example, the boxsize of the particles might be 100 pixels, but the particles are only 50 pixels in diameter. Aliasing effects are not always as deleterious for all specimens, and sometimes 2x padding isn't necessary; still, there are some benefits from 'oversampling' the data during averaging; so you might still want an average of size 2x, but perhaps particles in a box of 1.5x are sufficiently good for alignment. In this case, you would supply --clip=75||
|| ||iter||int||Default=1. The number of iterations to perform.||
|| ||path||string||Default=spt. Directory to store results in. The default is a numbered series of directories containing the prefix 'spt'; for example, spt_02 will be the directory by default if 'spt_01' already exists.||
|| ||npeakstorefine||int||Default=1. The number of best coarse alignments to refine in search of the best final alignment.||
|| ||preavgproc1||string||Default=None. A processor (see 'e2help.py processors -v 10' at the command line) to be applied to the raw particle after alignment but before averaging (for example, a threshold to exclude extreme values, or a highphass filter if you have phaseplate data.)||
|| ||preavgproc2||string||Default=None. A processor (see 'e2help.py processors -v 10' at the command line) to be applied to the raw particle after alignment but before averaging (for example, a threshold to exclude extreme values, or a highphass filter if you have phaseplate data.)||
|| ||parallel||bool||default=thread:1. Parallelism. See http://blake.bcm.edu/emanwiki/EMAN2/Parallel||
|| ||ppid||int||Default=-1. Set the PID of the parent process, used for cross platform PPID||
|| ||resume||string||(Not working currently). sptali_ir.json file that contains alignment information for the particles in the set. If the information is incomplete (i.e., there are less elements in the file than particles in the stack), on the first iteration the program will complete the file by working ONLY on particle indexes that are missing. For subsequent iterations, all the particles will be used.||
|| ||plots||bool||Default=False. Turn this option on to generate a plot of the ccc scores during each iteration in.png format (otherwise only .txt files will be saved). This option will also produce a plot of mean ccc score across iterations. Running on a cluster or via ssh remotely might not support plotting.||
|| ||savepreproc||bool||Default=False. Will save stacks of preprocessed particles (one for coarse alignment and one for fine alignment if preprocessing options are different).||
|| ||subset||int||Default=0 (not used). Refine only this substet of particles from the stack provided through --input||
|| ||savesteps||bool||Default=False. If set, this will save the average after each iteration to class_#.hdf. Each class in a separate file. Appends to existing files.||
|| ||saveali||bool||Default=False. If set, this will save the aligned particle volumes in class_ptcl.hdf. Overwrites existing file.||
|| ||saveallalign||bool||Default=False. If set, this will save an aligned stack of particles for each iteration||
|| ||saveallpeaks||bool||Default=False. If set, this will save the alignment information and score for all examined peaks --npeakstorefine during coarse alignment.||
|| ||sym||string||Default=None (equivalent to c1). Symmetry to impose -choices are: c<n>, d<n>, h<n>, tet, oct, icos||
||-v||verbose||int||Default=0. Verbose level [0-9], higner number means higher level of verboseness; 10-11 will trigger many messages that might make little sense since this level of verboseness corresponds to 'debugging mode'||
|| ||weighbytiltaxis||string||Default=None. A,B, where A is an integer number and B a decimal. A represents the location of the tilt axis in the tomogram in pixels (eg.g, for a 4096x4096xZ tomogram, this value should be 2048), and B is the weight of the particles furthest from the tiltaxis. For example, --weighbytiltaxis=2048,0.5 means that praticles at the tilt axis (with an x coordinate of 2048) will have a weight of 1.0 during averaging, while the distance in the x coordinates of particles not-on the tilt axis will be used to weigh their contribution to the average, with particles at the edge(0+radius or 4096-radius) weighing 0.5, as specified by the value provided for B.||
|| ||weighbyscore||bool||Default=False. This option will weigh the contribution of each subtomogram to the average by score/bestscore.||
|| ||goldstandardoff||bool||Default=False. This will PREVENT splitting the dataset provided through --input into two groups, and the entire dataset will be refined together. If this parameter is NOT supplied (and thus the refinement is 'gold standard') and --ref is supplied, two copies of the reference will be generated and randomphase-lowpass filtered to the resolution specified through --refrandphase.||
|| ||classmx||string||Default=None. The name of the classification matrix specifying how particles in 'input' should be grouped. If omitted, all particles will be averaged.||
|| ||recompute||bool||default=False. This parameter requires --classmx and will recompute averages (for example, even and odd) based on the classmx file and the alignment parameters specified therein for each particle. No refinements will follow. This is exclusively for recomputing averages.||
|| ||donotaverage||bool||Default=False. If e2spt_refinemulti.py is calling e2spt_classaverage.py, the latter need not average any particles, but rather only yield the alignment results.||
|| ||refpreprocess||bool||Default=False. This will preprocess the reference identically to the particles. It is off by default, but it is internally turned on when no reference is supplied. It should probably be off when using a crystal structure (with all positive densities) turned to EM density as an initial model, but it should be on when using an EM map.||
|| ||refrandphase||float||Default=0 (off). Resolution to phase randomize the reference to (or the two copies of the reference if --goldstandardoff is NOT supplied [gold standard refinement is on by default].||
|| ||hacref||int||Default=0 (not used by default). Size of the SUBSET of particles to use to build an initial reference by calling e2spt_hac.py which does Hierarchical Ascendant Classification (HAC) or 'all vs all' alignments.||
|| ||ssaref||int||Default=0 (not used by default). Size of the SUBSET of particles to use to build an initial reference by calling e2symsearch3d.py, which does self-symmetry alignments. You must provide --sym different than c1 for this to make any sense.||
|| ||btref||int||Default=0 (internally turned on and set to 64). Size of the SUBSET of particles to use to build an initial reference by calling e2spt_binarytree.py. By default, the largest power of two smaller than the number of particles in --input will be used. For example, if you supply a stack with 150 subtomograms, the program will automatically select 128 as the limit to use because it's the largest power of 2 that is smaller than 150. But if you provide, say --btref=100, then the number of particles used will be 64, because it's the largest power of 2 that is still smaller than 100.||
|| ||resultmx||string||Default=None. Specify an output image to store the result matrix. This is in the same format as the classification matrix. http://blake.bcm.edu/emanwiki/EMAN2/ClassmxFiles||
|| ||refinemultireftag||string||Default=''. DO NOT USE THIS PARAMETER. It is passed on from e2spt_refinemulti.py if needed.||
|| ||keep||float||Default=1.0 (all particles kept). The fraction of particles to keep in each class.||
|| ||keepsig||bool||Default=False. Causes the keep argument to be interpreted in standard deviations.||
|| ||averager||string||Default=mean.tomo. The type of averager used to produce the class average. Default=mean.tomo.||
|| ||nopreprocprefft||bool||Turns off all preprocessing that happens only once before alignment (--normproc, --mask, --maskfile, --clip, --threshold; i.e., all preprocessing excepting filters --highpass, --lowpass, --preprocess, and --shrink.||
|| ||shrink||int||Default=1 (no shrinking). Optionally shrink the input volumes by an integer amount for coarse alignment.||
|| ||shrinkfine||int||Default=1 (no shrinking). Optionally shrink the input volumes by an integer amount for refine alignment.||
|| ||threshold||string||Default=None. A threshold applied to the subvolumes after normalization. For example, --threshold=threshold.belowtozero:minval=0 makes all negative pixels equal 0, so that they do not contribute to the correlation score.||
|| ||mask||string||Default=None. Masking processor applied to particles before alignment. IF using --clip, make sure to express outer mask radii as negative pixels from the edge.||
|| ||maskfile||string||Default=None. Mask file (3D IMAGE) applied to particles before alignment. Must be in HDF format. Default is None.||
|| ||normproc||string||Default=None (see 'e2help.py processors -v 10' at the command line). Normalization processor applied to particles before alignment. If normalize.mask is used, results of the mask option will be passed in automatically. If you want to turn this option off specify 'None'||
|| ||preprocess||string||Any processor (see 'e2help.py processors -v 10' at the command line) to be applied to each volume prior to COARSE alignment. Not applied to aligned particles before averaging.||
|| ||preprocessfine||string||Any processor (see 'e2help.py processors -v 10' at the command line) to be applied to each volume prior to FINE alignment. Not applied to aligned particles before averaging.||
|| ||lowpass||string||Default=None. A lowpass filtering processor (see 'e2help.py processors -v 10' at the command line) to be applied to each volume prior to COARSE alignment. Not applied to aligned particles before averaging.||
|| ||lowpassfine||string||Default=None. A lowpass filtering processor (see 'e2help.py processors -v 10' at the command line) to be applied to each volume prior to FINE alignment. Not applied to aligned particles before averaging.||
|| ||highpass||string||Default=None. A highpass filtering processor (see 'e2help.py processors -v 10' at the command line) to be applied to each volume prior to COARSE alignment. Not applied to aligned particles before averaging.||
|| ||highpassfine||string||Default=None. A highpass filtering processor (see 'e2help.py processors -v 10' at the command line) to be applied to each volume prior to FINE alignment. Not applied to aligned particles before averaging.||
|| ||matchimgs||bool||Default=False. Applies filter.matchto to one image so that it matches the other's spectral profile during preprocessing for pair-wise alignment purposes.||
|| ||filterbyfsc||bool||Default=False. If on, this parameter will use dynamic FSC filtering. --lowpass will be used to build initial references if no --ref supplied, then, the FSC between the even and odd initial references will be used to filter the data during preprocessing. If --ref is supplied, --lowpass will be used during the first iteration to align the particles against the reference. Thereafter, the FSC between the most current particle average and the original reference (--ref) will be used in the next iteration.||
|| ||radius||float||Default=0 (which means it's not used by default). Hydrodynamic radius of the particle in Angstroms. This will be used to automatically calculate the angular steps to use in search of the best alignment. Make sure the apix is correct on the particles' headers, sine the radius will be converted from Angstroms to pixels. Then, the fine angular step is equal to 360/(2*pi*radius), and the coarse angular step 4 times that.||
|| ||precision||float||Default=1.0. Precision in pixels to use when figuring out alignment parameters automatically using --radius. Precision would be the number of pixels that the the edge of the specimen is moved (rotationally) during the finest sampling, --falign. If precision is 1, then the precision of alignment will be that of the sampling (apix of your images) times the --shrinkfine factor specified.||
|| ||search||int||"Default=8. During COARSE alignment, translational search in X, Y and Z, in pixels. This WILL overwrite any search: provided through --align, EXCEPT if you provide --search=8, which is the default. In general, just avoid providing search twice (through here and through the aligner, --align). If you do, just be careful to make them consistent to minimize misinterpretation and error.||
|| ||searchx||int||"Default=0. Not used. During COARSE alignment translational search in X, Y and Z, in pixels. Default=8. This WILL overwrite any search: provided through --align, EXCEPT if you provide --search=8, which is the default.

|| ||searchz||int||"Default=8. During COARSE alignment translational search in X, Y and Z, in pixels. Default=8. This WILL overwrite any search: provided through --align, EXCEPT if you provide --search=8, which is the default. In general, just avoid providing search twice (through here and through the aligner, --align). If you do, just be careful to make them consistent to minimize misinterpretation and error.||
|| ||searchfine||int||"Default=2. During FINE alignment translational search in X, Y and Z, in pixels. Default=2. This WILL overwrite any search: provided through --falign, EXCEPT if you provide --searchfine=2, which is the default. In general, just avoid providing search twice (through here and through the fine aligner --falign). If you do, just be careful to make them consistent to minimize misinterpretation and error.||
|| ||postprocess||string||Default=None. A processor to be applied to the FINAL volume after averaging the raw volumes in their FINAL orientations, after all iterations are done.||
|| ||procfinelikecoarse||bool||If you supply this parameters, particles for fine alignment will be preprocessed identically to particles for coarse alignment by default. If you supply this, but want specific parameters for preprocessing particles for also supply: fine alignment, nd supply fine alignment parameters, such as --lowpassfine, --highpassfine, etc; to preprocess the particles for FINE alignment differently than for COARSE alignment.||
|| ||falign||string||Default=None. This is the second stage aligner when the default aligner (rotate_translate_3d_tree) is NOT used. The fine alignment aligner is used to fine-tune the first alignment.||
|| ||faligncmp||string||Default=None. The default will depend on the aligner used (ccc.tomo or ccc.tomo.thresh). The comparator used by the second stage aligner.||
|| ||translateonly||bool||Default=False. This will force the aligner to not do any rotations and thus serves for translational centering. Specify search values through --search, otherwise its default value will be used.||
|| ||inputaliparams||string||Default=None. .json file containing a dict of transforms to apply to 'pre-align' the particles.||
|| ||breaksym||bool||Default=False. Break symmetry. Do not apply symmetrization after averaging, even if searching the asymmetric unit provided through --sym only for alignment. Default=False||
|| ||groups||int||Default=0 (not used; data not split). This parameter will split the data into a user defined number of groups. For purposes of gold-standard FSC computation later, select --group=2.||
|| ||randomizewedge||bool||Default=False. This parameter is EXPERIMENTAL. It randomizes the position of the particles BEFORE alignment, to minimize missing wedge bias and artifacts during symmetric alignment where only a fraction of space is scanned||
|| ||autocenter||string||WARNING: Experimental. Default=None. Autocenters each averaged pair during initial average generation with --btref and --hacref. Will also autocenter the average of all particles after each iteration of iterative refinement. Options are --autocenter=xform.centerofmass (self descriptive), or --autocenter=xform.centeracf, which applies auto-convolution on the average.||
|| ||autocentermask||string||WARNING: Experimental. Requires --autocenter. Default=None. Masking processor to apply before autocentering. See 'e2help.py processors -v 10' at the command line.||
|| ||autocenterpreprocess||bool||WARNING: Experimental. Requires --autocenter. Default=False. This will apply a highpass filter at a frequency of half the box size times the apix, shrink by 2, and apply a low pass filter at half nyquist frequency to any computed average for autocentering purposes if --autocenter is provided. Default=False.||
|| ||automask||bool||Applies a 3-D automask before centering. Can help with negative stain data, and other cases where centering is poor.||
|| ||resample||bool||If set, will perform bootstrap resampling on the particle data for use in making variance maps.||
|| ||tweak||bool||WARNING: BUGGY. This will perform a final alignment with no downsampling [without using --shrink or --shrinkfine] if --shrinkfine > 1.||
