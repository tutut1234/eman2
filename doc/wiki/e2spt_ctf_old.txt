||option||type||description||
||--defocusmax||float||Default=0.0, not used. If --autofit, maximum autofit defocus. A value will be estimated based on tilt angle and distance from the tilt axis.||
||--voltage||int||Default=200. Voltage of
		the microscope with which the images where collected. Supply it to replace the value
		in ctfparamsfile(s), or if ctfparamsfile(s) are lacking altogether.||
||--defocustop|| ||Assumes the signal for defocus measurement (e.g., carbon film) is at the top layer of the tomogram.||
||--mintiles||int||Minimum number of 'good tiles' in strip to consider it.||
||--subtiltsdir||str||Provide a directory containing individual stacks, where each stack is a 'mini tilt series' or a 'subtilt series' for single particles. Then, each image for each particle in the dir will be phase-phlipped using the ctf parameters you provide. If each image in the subtilt series is at a different defocus, then the parameters should be provided through --ctfparamsfile, whith a different defocus value per row. (There should be as many rows as images in each subtiltseries).||
||--autofit|| ||Runs automated
		CTF fitting on the input images, based on tiling.||
||--save2d|| ||If on, the CTF
		corrected subtiltseries will be saved as 2-D imag stacks [one per particle].||
||--verbose, -v||int||verbose level [0-9], higner number means higher level of verboseness.||
||--path||str||Directory to store results in. The default is a numbered series of directories containing the prefix 'sptctf'; for example, sptctf_02 will be the directory by default if 'sptctf_01' already exists.||
||--pad3d||float||Padding factor to zero-pad
		the reconstruction volume. (The final reconstructed subvolumes will be cropped to 
		the original size).||
||--firstfitglobal|| ||Default=False.
		Supplying this option will tile the entire image first (for each tilt angle) and find the average
		defocus. Then it will use that value to provide an educated 'guess' during stripe-by-stripe 
		fitting for each image.||
||--savestriptiles|| ||Saves
		all tiles for all strips, for all images, in one stack per strip.||
||--radius||int||Radius of the particle in pixels.||
||--imagestem||str||Default=None. If the images to apply ctf correction on are already unstacked and are individual mrc files, supply a common string to all of them.||
||--defocilist||str||Text file containing
		a single column of defocus values in microns. The file should have as many
		defocus values as images in the tiltseries or subtiltseries supplied.||
||--cs||float||Default=2.1. Cs of the microscope
		with which the images were collected. Supply it to replace the value in ctfparamsfile(s), 
		or if ctfparamsfile(s) are lacking altogether.||
||--exclude||str||Comma-separated list of image indexes in the --tiltseries to exclude from CTF fitting. For example, --exclude 0,3,4,6,7.||
||--tiltseries||str||Aligned tilt series. File format must be MRC and must have .mrc or .st or .ali extension.||
||--tltfile||str||File containing a list of 
		tilt angles corresponding to the tilt angles of images 0 to n of an aligned
		tilt series||
||--invert|| ||Invert the contrast of the output data, compared to the input data.||
||--saveffts|| ||Saves
		ffts of each average of tiles per strip, for all images.||
||-h, --help|| ||show this help message and exit||
||--bfactor||int||Default=1000. Bfactor or
		temperature factor to use. Supply it to replace the value
		in ctfparamsfile(s), or if ctfparamsfile(s) are lacking altogether.||
||--coords||str||text file containing x y z (or just z) coordinates for the particles, used to calculate icethickness if --icethicknessauto is specified for ctf fitting. NOT needed if --subtiltsdir is provided for ctf correction.||
||--generate_doc|| ||Extract help strings of each command line argument and generate wiki table.||
||--verbose, -v||int||verbose level [0-9], higner number means higher level of verboseness.||
||--stripstep||int||This will determine the
		amount of strips and the overlap between them for defocus estimation. The default 
		is half the tilesize. For example, for a 4000x4000 pixels image, a tile size of
		400 would yield 20, not 10 strips, by default. If --stripstep=1 were provided, the
		image would be devided into 4000-400=3600 strips. The first strip would go from pixel
		0 to pixel 400, the second strip from pixel 1 to pixel 401, the third from pixel 2
		to 402, etc... up to the las strip going from pixel 3600 to 4000.||
||--infodir||str||Folder typically produced by e2evalimage.py or previous runs of this program containing info.json files, one per tilt image in a tilt series. Each .json file should contain the fitted ctf and all associated parameters for each tilt image.||
||--icethicknessauto|| ||
		If --subtiltsdir is provided (and if --icethickness is *not* provided), the thickness of the 
		specimen in Z will be calculated by computing the difference between the largest 
		and the smallest Z coordinate found in the header of the subtiltseries, plus the size of the specimen, calculated from --radius.||
||--reconstructor||str||Default=fourier:mode=gauss_2. The reconstructor to use to reconstruct the tilt series into a tomogram. Type 'e2help.py reconstructors' at the command line to see all options and parameters available. To specify the interpolation scheme for the fourier reconstruction, specify 'mode'. Options are 'nearest_neighbor', 'gauss_2', 'gauss_3', 'gauss_5', 'gauss_5_slow', 'gypergeom_5', 'experimental'. For example --reconstructor=fourier:mode=gauss_5 ||
||--nozcorrection|| ||If you 
		turn on this option and --subtiltsdir is provided, the position in Z of each subtomogram
		will not be considered for CTF correction||
||--version|| ||show program's version number and exit||
||--framexsize||int||This correspond to the X
		size in pixes of the images/frames in the raw tilt series; that is, the size of the entire frame
		along the X axis (perpendicular to the direction of the tilt axis in the aligned tilt series).
		It is used to calculate the distance of each particle (subtiltseries) to the tilt axis, since
		this will induce different shifts in defocus in 3-D for the actual particles. Particles
		right at the tilt axis don't move "up" or "down" as they are tilted.
		This MUST be provided if --subtiltsdir is provided.
		Othwerwise, it will be read from the header of the images provided.||
||--pad2d||float||Padding factor to zero-pad
		the 2d images in the tilt series prior to reconstruction.
		(The final reconstructed subvolumes will be cropped to the original size).||
||--ppid||int||Set the PID of the parent process, used for cross platform PPID||
||--icethickness||int||This corresponds
		to the Z dimension in pixels of the reconstructed raw tomogram (uncropped), at the same binning
		(sampling) as the provided tiltseries, images or subtiltseries.
		This value MUST be provided, only if --subtiltsdir is given.
		||
||--defocusbottom|| ||Assumes the signal for defocus measurement (e.g., carbon film) is at the top layer of the tomogram.||
||--excludeedges|| ||Ignore 'excedent' (smaller than the width of a strip) at the edge of micrographs after dividing them into strips.||
||--phaseflipstrips|| ||This will
		perform phase flipping on images of an aligned tilt series on a strip-by-strip basis,
		assuming the supplied ctf parameters correspond to the proper values at the tilt axis,
		either the same values for all images (--defocus,--ampcont,--cs,--apix,--voltage,--bfactor)
		or a different set for each (--ctfparamsfile), taking into account the tilt angle for 
		each image (--tltfile), which should be supplied through an IMOD-like .tlt file.||
||--output||str||Filename for the output CTF-corrected tilt series.||
||--ctfparamsfile||str||This should be a text file
		with ctf parameters in the following format;
		defocus=value voltage=value cs=value apix=value bfactor=value ampcont=value
		A single space should separate each parameter from the next.
		Do not write any unit symbols for the values; just the numerical value.
		Defocus should be in microns, voltage in kV, apix in angstroms per pixel, and ampcont (amplitude contrast)
		should be a decimal; for example, 0.1 for 10 percent amplitude contrast.
		IF you want to use DIFFERENT PARAMETERS PER IMAGE, then the file must contain
		multiple rows with the different values.
		The first row will be used to phase flip the first image,
		the second row to phase flip the second, etc.||
||--ampcont||float||Default=0.05. Amplitude 
		contrast to use for CTF correction phase flipping. Supply it to replace the value
		in ctfparamsfile(s), or if ctfparamsfile(s) are lacking altogether.||
||--tilesize||int||Tile size to use for strips
		when --autofit is provided.||
||--defocus||float||Default=0. 
		Target defocus at the tilt axis. In the absence of ctfparamsfile(s)
		this value will be assumed to be the defocus at the tilt axis for all tilt images.||
||--defocusmin||float|| If --autofit, minimum autofit defocus. Default=0.0, not used. A value will be estimated based on tilt angle and distance from the tilt axis.||
||--defocusvariationlimit||float||default=0.1. total variation in defocus (in micrometers) tolerated within a strip and still consider it a region of 'constant defocus'.||
||--subset||int||Requires --subtiltsdir. Specify how many subtiltseries (or particles) to ctf correct. If you specify 10, the first 10 subtiltseires in --subtiltsdir will be corrected. 0 means "process all" because it makes no sense to process none||
||--apix||float||Default=whatever is on the header
		of the images. Sampling of the images in angstroms/pixel. 
		Supply --apix here to replace the value in ctfparamsfile(s), or if ctfparamsfile(s) 
		are lacking altogether.||
||--prunetest||float||Default=0.1.
		Decimal number that indicates the percentage of --tilesize (in terms of side length) 
		to tolerate of 'bad' values (i.e., empty regions of constant density) at the corners, 
		and still include the tile for CTF fitting. For example, if --tilesize=256, and
		--prunetest=0.1, a box of ~25-26 pixels each corner of every tile will be analyzed
		and if the standard deviation of any of the corners is 0, the tile will be excluded.
		To turn off this option supply --prunetest=-1.0. The program automatically adjusts 
		things so that the minimum size of regions at the corners to check will be 4x4 pixels.||
||--outputstem||str||Stem common to all
		output image stacks. For example, if --outputstem=myvirus and --save2d is provided, 
		the phase-flipped images for each subtiltseries wille be saved to myvirus_subtiltptclXXXX.hdf.
		If --save3d is provided, the stack of reconstructed subvolumes will be saved to myvirus_stack3d.hdf||
||--phaseflipwhole|| ||This 
		will perform phase flipping on the entire image for each image in an aligned tilt 
		series using the CTF parameters supplied.||
||--skipstripping||str||Default=None. Comma-separated list of image indexes to exclude from strip-based fitting (in this case, only global defocus tiling the entire image wil be measured).||
||--save3d|| ||If on, the CTF
		corrected subtiltseries will be reconstrcuted into subvolumes and save into a stack.
		Options --reconstructor, --pad2d, --pad3d are used if --save3d is on.||
